            The left side map on the ‘Home’ page is displayed in a road map style which provides general location information, 
			e.g. villages, cities, provinces, roads, water courses, borders etc.  This map has been implemented on the site to provide a 
			broad visualisation of the region.  The map can zoom in and out as required using the scroll wheel on the mouse or the ‘+’ or ‘-‘ 
			icons displayed in the top left corner of the map.  This map can also be changed to satellite style by selecting the option 
			on the drop down menu in the top right corner of the map.  

        </p></br>

                <p class="support">
            The primary purpose of the left side map is to select a chosen area and obtain a fixed position.  When you click on the map 
			you will see a display appear with the longitude and latitude coordinates.  This position is then used for the map on the right 
			side to identify ordinance records within the local vicinity.  </p></br>
                    
                 <p class="support">   Ordinance records will display on the map in 5 different colour to signify the bomb damage assessment (BDA) types</p></br>
				 <ul class="support_page">
				 <img class="ul_image" src="green.png" /><li>OBSERVED BOMB DETONATIONS  -  This includes bombs where the explosion was seen or where the target was destroyed. These are the least dangerous bombing sites.</li>
  					 </br>
				 <img class="ul_image" src="yellow.png" /><li>MISSED TARGET BOMB DROPS  -  These are sorties where the bomb did not hit the actual target but the bomb drop was observed. 
					 As the bomb site is less definite, this makes finding any unexploded munitions harder than when the explosion was observed.</li>
					 </br>
  				 <img class="ul_image" src="orange.png" /><li>SECONDARY EXPLOSIONS  -  These are sorties where a secondary explosion besides the bomb itself occurred. This would cause a higher amount of shrapnel and could be dangerous to inspect.</li>
  					 </br>
				 <img class="ul_image" src="red.png" /><li>UNOBSERVED  -  In these bombing runs, the explosion was not observed for one of a variety of reasons. This makes it more likely to have unexploded 
					 munitions and to be harder to find the exact bombing site. These are very dangerous locations and are assigned red, a colour with strong associations with danger. </li>
  					 </br>
				 <img class="ul_image" src="red_dot.png" /><li>SEEDED  -  Seeded bombing runs are those where cluster munitions were used to seed the area with munitions. These bombing runs are the most dangerous locations and 
					 are given a red colour but with a dot to represent the seeding. There are only a small number of bombing runs with this BDA but it was important to 
					 distinguish them from the unobserved locations while still showing them both as very dangerous. </li>
				 </br>
				 </ul>

            After selecting a position on the left side map, mouse click on the markers that display on the right side map to visually present 
			an image of the bomb type found at the location, it will also provide written detail on the proposed target, bomb type and bomb damage 
			assessment (BDA).  The right side map will display markers within rectangular area selected in the left side map.
        </p></br>

            There is also a 'Get Data' button below the left side map. This will take you to another page that will present bombing information 
			in textual form.  This information is presented on the same basis, i.e. data and bombing within an approximate 460 meter radius of 
			the position selected on the left side map.
