Preamble
Laos is a South East Asian country boarded by China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Burma. Its 2015 population is just over 7 million people. The country was greatly affected by war during the 1960's and 1970's. To get an understanding of the devastation caused as a result of the Vietnam War between 1964 and 1973, below are a few statistics as purported by the Mine Advisory Group (MAG).



The Reality
Laos is the most bombed country in the world per capita, with more than 270 million cluster submunitions dropped during the Vietnam War.
More than 1.8 billion kg of bombs were dropped on Laos during the Vietnam War between 1964 and 1973, including over 270 million submunitions.
Up to 80 million cluster munitions failed to detonate, unexploded ordinance (UXO), remaining live and in the ground after the end of the war
By the end of 2012, there had been at least 50,000 casualties (including 29,000 deaths) from incidents involving UXO's


To provide a brief background of MAG, at the time of creating this site (May 2015) MAG operated in 16 countries in a bid to decontaminate and reclaim land affected by conflict, reducing the risk of injury and death to the local population.



Our Aim
This site aspires to provide humanitarian benefit to the people of Laos through an informative and understandable medium. It has been initiated for the purpose of providing the people of Laos and other stakeholders with a visual aid to assist with determining potentially dangerous geographical locations within the country's 17 provinces. The layout of the site intends to be clear and simple to use for any person wishing to use it, no matter their preferred language or level of technical skill. Over 64,000 sorties records have been obtained from the US National Archives detailing the bombing missions undertaken in the Laos region during the Vietnam War. These records also provided detail on Unexploded Ordinance (UXO), i.e. bombs that were deployed where no detonation was observed. While the site intends to be informative in relation to potentially contaminated land within the Laos region, the information displayed is for educational purposes only and does not provide up to date information on decontamination efforts in the region and does not report on changing environmental conditions since the war.
